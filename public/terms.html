			<p>Welcome to Time Travel! Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms") carefully before using or obtaining any content, products, or services through our Websites (defined below), mobile applications or other online products and services, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. Access to and use of the Services (defined below) is subject to acceptance of these Terms. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services, and is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. By accessing, using or obtaining any content, products, or services through the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not accept all of these Terms, then please do not use the Services.</p>

			<p>We may modify, revise or update these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy, at any time, by updating this posting. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current Terms, because they are binding on you. Your continued use of our Services, following the posting of conspicuous notice of any modification, will be subject to the Terms in effect at the time of your use. Certain provisions of these Terms may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular areas of the Services.</p>

			<p>These Terms supersede any prior Orbitz Terms and Conditions relating to the use of the Services that were displayed on the Services before the date stated above. Unless specifically provided, they do not supersede any additional Supplier terms for carriage, awards, or attractions provided elsewhere on the Services.</p>
